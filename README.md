# Bank-Loan-Decision-Making-Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to measure and improve the efficiency of healthcare recruitment processes across different regions using real-world job vacancy data. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help healthcare organizations optimize their hiring pipelines, reduce time-to-fill, and address workforce shortages strategically.

Objective:
To build a regional recruitment efficiency tracker that highlights hiring bottlenecks, identifies high-performing regions, and forecasts recruitment demand based on historical trends.

Key Analyses Performed:

Regional analysis of job vacancies and fill rates

Time-to-hire and vacancy aging metrics

Identification of staffing shortages by specialty/department

A/B testing of recruitment strategies and campaign performance

Trend analysis of application volume over time

Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL: Data extraction and transformation from healthcare job datasets.

Python: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and A/B testing using pandas, numpy, and scipy.

Tableau / Power BI: Visualization of KPIs, regional comparison maps, and trend dashboards.

Outcomes:

Developed a visual tracker to monitor recruitment KPIs at the regional level.
